2D mobile videogame

The course was dived in 2 halfs:
in the first one we learned how the mobile videogame industry works, diving in to the theory of how to make a good selling mobile videogame,
the second half was dedicated at the creation of a mobile app.

We ended up creating a GDD(Game Design Document) as if we were selling our app to a possible investor, and making a small videogame.
The app consist in a Fantasy RPG Gotcha type of app where the protagonists are fantasy dogs.
The main focuses where the idea of the game and to find a solid and catchy game loop.
The process was kinda hard, but we were so proud of what we ended up with, although the rusult may seems a bit naked, due to the fact that visual effects and animation were not our main concern and how much time consuming was the turn-based combact system.

Here the link to the files(the project are heavy and git is giving me trouble uploading them):

If you are trying our project:
the app consist in a demo of a possibile gotcha kind of game, where you can also have your companions join battles in an turn-based combact.
You are able to navigate through the menus, check your companions, and join battles, commands are all pretty intuitive, be curious to try it.
